Government is supposed to be freely accessible. You're supposed to 
participate in the legislative process and stay educated about how
your government operates, who represents you, and what bodies of 
government determine the laws we all abide. 

With increasing political polarization and the modern search for
"truth," people learn about government and their representatives 
through the media. The media is the filter between us and our 
government, our laws, our representatives. It's time for a change.


This product aims to make educating oneself about the goings-on in 	
government a click away! Whether that involves 
knowing who your representatives are, or what your government is
up to.
